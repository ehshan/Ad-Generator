# Ad Generator
***

This repo contains the training scripts for experiments with Neural Language Model capable of generating text ads.
There are 2 models, a multi-layer LSTM (*primary.py*), and a Sequence-to-Sequence model (*conditioned.py*). 
Both models were built using  Keras with a TensorFlow backend. 

The full training corpus and run-able versions of the models are available upon request.
